# ELFread

## What is ELFread?

ELFread is a simplistic program for reading out the ELF header and it's sections.

## Usage

First compile the project by executing `make` in the Project directory.  
Please note that gcc (build-essential) and make are required for building.  
Now you can execute ELFread, which should have been created by the Makefile  
with the path to an ELF file. This will display some information.
